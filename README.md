# Actions Cleaner

This is an action to try to make as much space on the GitHub runner as we can!
Yes, we are building LLVM. üòÇÔ∏è

```yaml
name: Actions Cleaner

on: 
  pull_request: []
 
jobs:
  update:
    name: Clean All The Things!
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run Actions Cleaner
        uses: rse-ops/actions-cleaner/ubuntu@main
```

For detailed usage, see the actions.yml in [ubuntu](ubuntu) - mostly every removal can be customized so you
can instead keep it! Here is an example:


```yaml
name: Actions Cleaner

on: 
  pull_request: []
 
jobs:
  update:
    name: Clean All The Things!
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run Actions Cleaner
        uses: rse-ops/actions-cleaner/ubuntu@main
        with:
          remove_node: false
          remove_ruby: false
```

We have them organized by base runner in case someone
else wants to add others! If you need space in addition to this, you can try out
[easimon/maximize-build-space](https://github.com/easimon/maximize-build-space#how-it-works) which
tries to consolidate filesystems.
